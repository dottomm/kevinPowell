    - bio: Debbie  McBee is one of the two Statewide Implementation Coaches for the PEPTI project.  She brings to this role more than 30 years of experience in Early Childhood Education. Her passion for the field was ignited when her oldest child was in Head Start.  This is where she learned about inclusion and committed herself to supporting all children, by seeing the child first and not what’s in their Individual Education Plan.  This includes a desire to see all children starting with the 0-5 population welcomed in all settings where they can just be kids.   
    - bio: In her new role, Debbie is excited to partner with selected LEAs across the state as they implement systems and strategies using the Embedded Instruction and Practiced Based Coaching model in inclusive preschool classrooms to build and strengthen the preschool practitioners' consistent application of effective practices that support child learning using everyday routines and activities.   
    - bio: Debbie has served in many diverse roles over the years, including preschool teacher, adjunct professor, resource and referral director, administrator for small and large child development programs, training and technical assistant provider and manager for the Office of Head Start at the state and national level, and most recently, private consultant supporting child development programs.
   
    - bio: No matter her role, she is always vocal and shares her passion to see all children belong because every child deserves to be seen, heard and accepted.
